= TLS Check disabling agent
:icons: font

This is an agent that allows us to disable checking TLS certificates as getting matching TLS certificates might be difficult in a local development setup.

== More information

This utilizes the https://github.com/alech/java-instrumentation-tool[Java Instrumentation Tool] that is available on GitHub.

== Building and using the agent

Run the following script

[source,bash]
----
./buildtlsagent.sh
----

Afterwards, add this agent to the JVM options as in the following example for `kcadm.sh`.

NOTE: for running the Gatling tests, this agent is not needed. Gatling will connect anyway.

[source,bash]
----
export KC_OPTS="-javaagent:${PWD}/tlscheckdisable-agent.jar"
./kcadm.sh config credentials --server https://keycloak-keycloak....nip.io/ --realm master --user ... --password ...
----
