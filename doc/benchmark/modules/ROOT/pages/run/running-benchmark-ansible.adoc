:navtitle: Running via Ansible and EC2
:description: This extends the generic CLI of the kcb.sh script with an automated setup using Ansible for Amazon Web Services EC2 instances to run the load tests.

{description}

include::partial$run/when-to-run-ansible-and-ec2.adoc[]

== Prerequisites

. Keycloak URL from xref:preparing-keycloak.adoc[]
. xref:kubernetes-guide::prerequisite/prerequisite-awscli.adoc[]
. Install Ansible CLI (on Fedora, use `dnf install ansible`)

== EC2 instances for load generation

=== Folder layout

In the folder `link:{github-files}/ansible[ansible]`, there are the following files and folders:

`roles/aws_ec2`:: Ansible role.
`roles/aws_ec2/defaults/main.yml`:: Ansible role's defaults, can be overwritten in `env.yml` which is picked up by the wrapper script.
`aws_ec2.sh`:: Wrapper script.

=== Configuration

Create a configuration file `env.yml` to configure your environment.
Use the file `link:{github-files}/ansible/env_example.yml[env_example.yaml]` as an example.

.Example contents to configure EC2 environment via `env.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
cluster_size: 5
instance_type: t3.small
instance_volume_size: 30
----

The most important parameters to customize in `env.yml` are:

`cluster_size`:: Number of instances to be created.
As default, Gatling will create new HTTP connections for each new user.
As the network stack of the load driver can be congested with a lot of connections in the `TIME_WAIT` state, consider using one EC2 instance per 250 users per seconds.

`instance_type`:: Size of instances to be created, see https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/[AWS instance types].

=== Creating EC2 instances

NOTE: Instances will be bound to the IP address of the system which creates them!

When creating the instances, the public IP address of the host creating the machines is added to the EC2 security group, and only this IP address is allowed to log in to the load drivers via SSH.
When the public IP address changes you'll need to re-run the `create` command.
The public IP address changes, for example, when changing locations or networks, or when the internet connection at home renews the IP address every night.
The message displayed when the IP address of the host running Ansible can't connect is "`Failed to connect to the host via ssh`".

. Install the required Ansible AWS collections.
+
----
./aws_ec2.sh requirements
----

. Create EC2 instances and related infrastructure.
It takes about 5 minutes for this to complete.
+
----
./aws_ec2.sh create <REGION>
----
+
This will create an Ansible host inventory file and a matching SSH private key to access the hosts:
+
--
- `+benchmark_<USERNAME>_<REGION>_inventory.yml+`
- `+benchmark_<USERNAME>_<REGION>.pem+`
--

=== Stop / Start EC2 instances

After the creation, the EC2 instances are running.
To safe costs, consider stopping them and starting them later when needed.
This is a little bit less time-consuming than creating the instances again.

----
./aws_ec2.sh stop <REGION>
./aws_ec2.sh start <REGION>
----

The `start` action will recreate the host inventory file with the restarted hosts`' new IP addresses.

=== Debugging EC2 instances

To analyze a problem on an EC2 instance, use `ssh` to open a shell on the instance using the key created in the installation step.
See the inventory file for the IP addresses of the EC2 instances.

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
ssh ec2-user@**<ip>** -i benchmark_**<user>**_**<region>**.pem
----

=== Delete EC2 instances and related resources

When no longer needed, delete all EC2 load generator nodes in a region:

----
./aws_ec2.sh delete <REGION>
----

This will delete the instances and related resources, and the local inventory file and private key.

== Benchmark

=== Folder layout

`roles/benchmark`:: Ansible role.
`roles/benchmark/defaults/main.yml`:: Ansible role's defaults.
Can be overwritten in `env.yml` which is picked up by the wrapper script.
`benchmark.sh`:: Wrapper script.

=== Configuration

Update the configuration file `env.yml` to configure your environment.
Use the file `link:{github-files}/ansible/env_example.yml[env_example.yaml]` as an example.

.Example contents to configure the benchmark execution via `env.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
kcb_zip: ../benchmark/target/keycloak-benchmark-0.10-SNAPSHOT.zip
kcb_heap_size: 1G
----

=== Install and run the benchmark

Provide the region as the first parameter, and then the parameters as they would apply to the `kcb.sh` script.
See xref:run/running-benchmark-cli.adoc[] for details.

The playbooks parse some parameters to generate the output structure and to distribute the load, therefore the parameter `scenario` is required.
If the parameter `concurrent-users` is provided, it needs to be a multiple of EC2 nodes the load is distributed.

Use the parameter `concurrent-users` or `users-per-sec` to specify the total load run against the Keycloak instances.
The playbook reads the `concurrent-users` or `users-per-sec` provided on the command line, and divide those numbers by number of EC2 instances before passing the value to each `kcb.sh` script running on the EC2 instances.

[source,bash]
----
./benchmark.sh <REGION> <P1> <P2> ... <Pn>
----

A possible command would look like the following:

[source,bash]
----
./benchmark.sh eu-west-1 --scenario=keycloak.scenario.authentication.ClientSecret \
    --server-url=https://keycloak-runner-keycloak.apps.....openshiftapps.com \
    --users-per-sec=1000 \
    --measurement=600 \
    --realm-name=realm-0 \
    --clients-per-realm=10000
----

This will install Keycloak Benchmark on hosts listed in the `benchmark_<USERNAME>_<REGION>_inventory.yml`
and run the benchmark passing the parameters P1, P2, â€¦ Pn, to the `kcb.sh` script.

Other parameters can be customized via `env.yml` file.

Version of benchmark to install can be specified via `kcb_version` parameter.

It is also possible to directly provide `kcb_zip` parameter if the file is already available locally, or the `kcb_zip_url` from which the benchmark will be downloaded.
The `kcb_version` will then be extracted from the filename.

Parameter `skip_install` can be used to skip the installation step.
In that case variable `kcb_version` must be provided based on what has been previously installed.

=== Benchmark results

The aggregate report from the distributed simulation will be stored locally in the folder files relative to the execution directory.
