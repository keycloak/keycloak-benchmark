= Benchmark Guide for Keycloak Benchmark

Currently, performance tests are using Gatling as the runtime, where the simulations were extracted from the Keycloak Performance Test Suite and wrapped into a standalone tool that allows running tests using a CLI.

Note: this tool assumes you have a running keycloak setup, and if you want to load the keycloak server with some seed data, please see xref:dataset-guide:ROOT:index.adoc[Dataset Module Instructions].

== Build

Build `keycloak-benchmark` module:

----
mvn -f benchmark/pom.xml clean install
----

As a result, you should have a ZIP and tar.gz file in the target folder.

----
benchmark/target/keycloak-benchmark-${version}.[zip|tar.gz]
----

== Install

Extract the `keycloak-benchmark-${version}.[zip|tar.gz]` file.

== Prepare keycloak for testing

Before running tests, make sure realms are configured as follows:

* Realms must have `User Registration` setting enabled.

Some scenarios require a service account with the clientId `gatling`:

* select the realm that is used for testing
* create a client with the name `gatling`
* set access type to `confidential`
* check `Service Account Enabled`
* enter a valid redirect uri (e.g. `http://localhost`)
* click save
* Change to the tab `Sevice Account Roles`
* select for `realm-management` in the `Client Roles` listbox
* assign the roles, based on the below role-mapping table for the respective load simulation scenario
* the client secret to be passed to the tests can be copied from the `Credentials` tab

|===
|Scenario Name |Assigned Roles

|CreateClient |manage-clients, view-users
|CreateDeleteClient |manage-clients, view-users
|CrawlUsers |manage-clients, view-users
|CreateRole |manage-realm
|CreateDeleteRole |manage-realm
|CreateClientScope |manage-clients, view-users
|CreateDeleteClientScope |manage-clients, view-users
|CreateGroup |manage-users
|CreateDeleteGroup |manage-users
|CreateUsers |manage-users
|CreateDeleteUsers |manage-users
|===

Instead of following the above manual steps, you can use this link:{github-files}/benchmark/manage_gatling_client.sh[manage_gatling_client.sh] script to do the setup for you.

Login to the Keycloak server using the kcadm cli script, which comes with any Keycloak distribution

[source,shell]
----
$KEYCLOAK_HOME/bin/kcadm.sh config credentials --server http://localhost:8081/auth --realm master --user admin --password admin

----

and then run this, for creating the needed realm and client

[source,shell]
----
./manage_gatling_client.sh -c gatling

----

or run this, to recreate the realm and client for any reason

[source,shell]
----
./manage_gatling_client.sh -d

----

=== Scenarios `keycloak.scenario.admin.CreateRealms` and `keycloak.scenario.admin.CreateDeleteRealms`

These scenarios are using the root admin account to perform realm operations with the built-in `admin-cli` client.

This information is specified to the scenarios with options `--admin-username` and `--admin-password`.

Usage of a service account token is irrelevant with these scenarios, because:

* real-world realm operations are performed using root admin credentials
* deleting a just-created realm requires realm-specific permissions which are set onto a realm-specific client, which would require to logout then login again using the realm-specific client to perform the realm deletion operation
* as the token includes all realm permissions, it would grow very fast and would quickly exceed the maximum length for header (leading to `431 Request Header Fields Too Large` responses).

== Run

To start running tests:

----
./kcb.sh
----

By default, tests expect Keycloak running on http://localhost:8080/auth, and the default scenario is `keycloak.scenarion.authentication.ClientScret`.

To use a different server URL and scenario:

----
./kcb.sh --scenario=keycloak.scenario.authentication.AuthorizationCode --server-url=http://localhost:8080
----

== Options

You can set different options to change how tests should be executed.
For a complete list of the available options, see link:{github-files}/benchmark/src/main/java/org/keycloak/benchmark/Config.java[Config.java].

== Report

For the default gatling generated reports, check reports at the `result` directory.

To generate a custom differential or trend line report from an existing repository of gatling simulations, you can use the link:{github-files}/benchmark/generate-custom-report.sh[generate-custom-report.sh] based on https://github.com/nuxeo/gatling-report/blob/master/README.md[gatling-report] project.

Example Usage:

[source,shell]
----
#for differential with custom template
./generate-custom-report.sh -v 6.0 -s "~/JPAMapUndertow/simulation.log ~/HotRodUndertow/simulation.log" -d ~/reports/differential/templates -t src/main/resources/diff-v2.mustache

#for trend lines with default template
./generate-custom-report.sh -v 6.0 -s "~/JPAMapUndertow/simulation.log ~/HotRodUndertow/simulation.log ~/LegacyWildFly/simulation.log" -d ~/reports/trendLines/templates
----

_Note: The differential HTML is represented by a boxplot chart with a "bee swarm" of all the response time data points._

== A little more about the boxplot with bee swarm chart:

The box plot (a.k.a. box and whisker diagram) is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
In the simplest box plot the central rectangle spans the first quartile to the third quartile (the interquartile range or IQR).
A segment inside the rectangle shows the median and "whiskers" above and below the box show the locations of the minimum and maximum.

A bee swarm plot is a one-dimensional scatter plot similar to “strip chart”, except that would-be overlapping points are separated by a jitter value, such that each is visible.

The below sample image, represents one of the several boxplot charts, from the differential HTML report.
In the case of the challenger, the IQR (interquartile range is from 21 ms to 53), median is 34 ms, with min and max being, 13 and 84 respectively.
The bee swarm plot adjascent to the box plot, represents the overall distribution pattern, with x-axis value being randomly assigned by the jitter value to avoid super-imposition when there are many same y-axis data points.
