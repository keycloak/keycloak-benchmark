= Benchmark Guide for Keycloak Benchmark

Performance tests use Gatling as the runtime, and users can be them as a standalone tool using a CLI.

NOTE: This tool assumes you have a running keycloak setup, and if you want to load the keycloak server with some seed data, please see xref:dataset-guide:ROOT:index.adoc[Dataset Module Instructions].

== Next Steps

. Set up a Keycloak instance, for example using xref:kubernetes-guide::installation-minikube.adoc[], or use an existing Keycloak instance.
. Continue with either xref:building-benchmark.adoc[] or xref:downloading-benchmark.adoc[].
. Then xref:preparing-keycloak.adoc[] and xref:run/running-benchmark-cli.adoc[].
. Finally use xref:reporting.adoc[] to gain insights how Keycloak performs under load.
