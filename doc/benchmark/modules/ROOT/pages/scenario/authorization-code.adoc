= Scenario AuthorizationCode
:description: Login a user with a username and password and exchange the authentication code.

{description}.

See xref:scenario-overview.adoc[] for a list of all scenarios.

== Steps of the scenario

. Open the login page.
. Login with username and password.
. Exchange the authentication code for a token.
. Logout.

See the source code at link:{github-files}/benchmark/src/main/scala/keycloak/scenario/authentication/AuthorizationCode.scala[AuthorizationCode.scala] for details.

== Running an example scenario

=== Prerequisites:

* Keycloak is running.
* Realm, user and client exist with the values listed on the CLI.
* The client needs to have client authentication enabled, which results in an OIDC type of confidential access type, as the confidential client secret is used in the authorization code exchange.
* This scenario doesn't need any service account roles set for the client.

See xref:preparing-keycloak.adoc[] for details how to automate this for the realm and the client.

=== Running the scenario

The following scenario runs with the default settings for 30 seconds.

See xref:configuration.adoc[] for additional CLI options.

[source,bash]
