= Creating a custom report
:description: Users can create custom reports based on Gatling's simulation log

{description}

Use this report to gain additional insights, or to create a report of a distributed run with multiple simulation runs.

See xref:reporting.adoc[] for more information on how to access information from a Gatling run.

== Preparing the report

To generate a custom report from a previous Gatling run, use the link:{github-files}/benchmark/src/main/content/bin/generate-custom-report.sh[generate-custom-report.sh] based on https://github.com/nuxeo/gatling-report/blob/master/README.md[gatling-report] project.

To create a report from a distributed run with multiple simulation logs, combine the different to a single file first, then run the report.
