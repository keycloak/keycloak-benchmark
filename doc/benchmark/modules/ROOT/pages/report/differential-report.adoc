See xref:reporting.adoc[] for more information on how to access information from a Gatling run.

== Preparing the report

To generate a custom differential report from an existing repository of gatling simulations, use the link:{github-files}/benchmark/generate-custom-report.sh[generate-custom-report.sh] based on https://github.com/nuxeo/gatling-report/blob/master/README.md[gatling-report] project.
