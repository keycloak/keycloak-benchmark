= Results summary
:description: There shell script creates a summary JSON which can be used to compare different runs.

{description}

== JSON created for each run

For every run, `kcb.sh` creates a file `results.json` which contains the input parameters
to Gatling and also an output of the results.

Each result summarizes a run, and can be processed further in a pipeline.
Each run has a descriptive name and a UUID which identifies the run.
The file name contains a timestamp and the UUID, so it is simple to put multiple result files in a single folder for further processing.

A user of the `kcb.sh` script might want to capture information about the system under test (SUT) as part of the result file to record the information for later use.
To do this, the user has to provide a script which collects the information and prints them on the console.
For a ROSA environment, there is link:{github-files}/provision/aws/rosa_describe.sh[rosa_describe.sh] which would collect the information about the cluster.
When the environment variable `SUT_DESCRIBE` is set, `kcb.sh` calls the executable and CLI arguments given in the environment variable `SUT_DESCRIBE` to retrieve the JSON description for the system under test.
It then adds it to the file with the key `system_under_test`.
See link:{github-files}/.github/actions/oc-keycloak-login/action.yml[oc-keycloak-login/action.yml] how the environment variable is set for a GitHub workflow.

When running this from a GitHub Workflow, the file name is recorded in the GitHub Action output `kcb_result` so it can be picked up in later steps in the GitHub Workflow.

== Summarizing report for the scalability test

For the scalability test, there is link:/keycloak-benchmark/dashbuilder[a report visualizing the latest runs here].

The process that leads to this diagram is as follows:

. The link:{github-files}/.github/workflows/keycloak-scalability-benchmark.yml[Keycloak - Scalability benchmark GitHub workflow] commits a result file to the `link:{github-files}/../result-data/[result-data]` branch of the repository on each successful run.

. For https://www.dashbuilder.org/[Dashbuilder], the data needs to be available as a single JSON file.
This is generated using the link:{github-files}/../result-data/.github/workflows/aggregate-results.yaml[Aggregate Benchmark results GitHub workflow] in the `result-data` branch of the repository.

. The data is then published to GitHub pages in the link:{github-files}/.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml[Publishing Documentation Site GitHub workflow], as the file created for the releases can't be fetched by Dashbuilder, as the initial response is an HTTP redirect.

. The dashboard is built using https://www.dashbuilder.org[Dashbuilder] using this  `link:{github-files}/dashbuilder/static/dashboard.yaml[dashboard.yaml]` file.
There is an https://start.kubesmarts.org/[interactive dashboard builder] to interactively change the diagram.
See the https://www.dashbuilder.org/docs/[Dashbuilder docs] on how to update the YAML file.
