= Modes in kcb.sh script

This is part of the `kcb.sh` script which was referenced in xref:run/running-benchmark-cli.adoc[].

In the `--incremental` mode, the code sets up a benchmark to go through a warm-up phase using the `run_benchmark_with_workfload` function and then moves onto the `incremental` phase where benchmark is executed for incrementing the workload each time. If a benchmark fails, the script tries to perform a binary lookup to reduce the increment value by half of the last successful workload, and in the end if it reaches a value of 1(by the means of integer math), it will assume it reached the maximum possible successful workload and prints the same information to the user.

In the `--single-run` mode, which is the default mode when the `--incremental` flag is not set on the CLI command, the script directly runs the benchmark with the provided workload and exits without any further processing.

In the `--chaos` mode, the code sets up a single-run mode benchmark in parallel with a failure simulating `kc-chaos.sh` script to kill a random pod after a certain time interval. It can take an input `CHAOS_TIMEOUT` to stop the simulated failures after a given timeout.

Overall the `kcb.sh` script executes the benchmark in either incremental or single-run mode, handles errors and provides informative output messages during the process.
