= Changing the dataset provider
:description: This guide describes how to create local modifications to the dataset provider by a developer.

{description}

== Overview

This guide targets Java developers.

To be able to test changes made to the provider, the provider needs to be deployed in a running instance of Keycloak.
After each change to the provider's JAR file, it needs to be re-deployed to Keycloak.

== Prerequisites

Knowledge of Java and of Keycloak's Java APIs necessary or needs to be learned during development.

The recommended setup is to first complete the guide xref:installation/installation-minikube.adoc[] as it is fully scripted and prepared for remote debugging.

Developing the provider against Keycloak Wildfly, or with a locally running instance of Keycloak Quarkus is possible as well, still it is not part of this guide today.

== Preparing changes using the local setup

After opening the Keycloak Benchmark project in an IDE, proceed as follows to implement new or changed requirements:

. Change the source code in `/dataset/src` as needed.
. Start the test class `DeploymentIT` from the IDE from the module's file path.
It will package the provider and install into a Quarkus instance of Keycloak.
. Open \http://localhost:8080 to interact with Quarkus, and use remote-debugging.
. Remote debugging is available on port 8787, and test the xref:using-provider.adoc#dataset-provider-apis[provider's REST APIs].
. Repeat from step 1 until the requirements are satisfied.

== Preparing changes using the Minikube setup

After opening the Keycloak Benchmark project in an IDE, proceed as follows to implement new or changed requirements:

. Change the source code in `/dataset/src` as needed.
. Run the `task` as described in xref:kubernetes-guide::installation.adoc[] to update the installation.
This builds a new version of the dataset provider's JAR file, deploys it to minikube and restarts Keycloak.
. Follow the instructions in xref:kubernetes-guide::util/debugging-keycloak.adoc[] to connect to the running Keycloak instance and debug the provider, and test the provider's API as outlined in xref:using-provider.adoc[].
. Repeat from step 1 until the requirements are satisfied.
