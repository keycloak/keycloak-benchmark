== Installing on minikube

The installation including building the provider locally is part of the provisioning script.

The steps include:

. Building the dataset provider using Maven from the local sources.
. Placing it in the folder `provision/minikube/keycloak/providers`.
. Running Helm to deploy Keycloak plus the provider to the locally running minikube.
. Wait for the re-deployment to complete.

== Verifying the installation

To verify the installation, access the URL of your Keycloak server at:

----

On successful installation, it shows a message similar to:
