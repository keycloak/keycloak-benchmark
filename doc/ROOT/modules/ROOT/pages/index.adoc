= Kubernetes Benchmark
:navtitle: Welcome

The https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark[Keycloak Benchmark repository] contains the necessary tools to run performance tests of a https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak server].

It has the following goals:

. Setup Keycloak for reproducible results.
. Run load tests against any Keycloak instance.
. Use an observability stack to analyze test runs.

The repository has multiple modules that can be used together or separately to achieve this:

* The xref:benchmark-guide::index.adoc[benchmark module] contains load tests based on Gatling.

* The provisioning module contains a more advanced xref:kubernetes-guide::index.adoc[Kubernetes setup] based on minikube,  and docker-compose scripts for a simpler setup.
The setup for minikube contains a Grafana based observability stack while the docker-compose based setup doesn't.

* The xref:dataset-guide::index.adoc[dataset module] contains a Keycloak add-on that can create entities in a Keycloak data store to prepare it for a load test.

== Next steps

Continue to xref:getting-started.adoc[] to set up an environment and run load tests.
