{description}
It summarizes the logic which is condensed in the Helm charts and scripts in this project to make it accessible as independent knowledge to adapt it to other environments.

IMPORTANT: Most of the guides are now available as the High availability guides on https://www.keycloak.org/high-availability/introduction[Keycloak's main website].
Once they had been published as part of the Keycloak 23 release, they have been removed from this site.

These guides will eventually be published Keycloak's main web page.
