// Infinispan -> clear caches on secondary site and perform the state transfer
// Keycloak -> clear caches (how?)
// Aurora -> ?
// Route53 -> no-op

== Audience

This guide describes the procedures required to synchronize the secondary site after a temporary disconnection between sites.

See xref:running/index.adoc[] for additional guides.

=== {ispn} Cluster

For the context of this guide, `{site-a}` is the primary site and `{site-b}` is the secondary site.

Network partitions may happen between the site and the replication between the {ispn} cluster will stop.
Manual steps described in this guide bring both site back in sync.

WARNING: Transferring the full state may impact the {ispn} cluster perform by increasing the response time and/or resources usage.

First procedure is to delete the stale data from the secondary site.

. Login into your secondary site.

. Shutdown Keycloak.

include::partial$running/infinispan-cli-clear-caches.adoc[]

Now we are ready to transfer the state from the primary site to the secondary site.

. Login into your primary site

include::partial$running/infinispan-cli-connect.adoc[]

include::partial$running/infinispan-cli-state-transfer.adoc[]

As now the state is available in the secondary datacenter, Keycloak can be started again:

. Login into your secondary site.

. Startup Keycloak.
