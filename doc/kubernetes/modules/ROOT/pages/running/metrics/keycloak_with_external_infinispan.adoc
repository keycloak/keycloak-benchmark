= {project_name} with external {jdgserver_name} deployment
:description: This document contains details of the {project_name} metrics that can be used to monitor your deployment's performance.

{description}

The deployment described in this document is for multi-site deployments.
In this architecture, {project_name} nodes use an external {jdgserver_name} to store the cached data.

If your deployment does not use an external {jdgserver_name}, check xref:./keycloak_cluster.adoc[] guide.

== {ispn} Caches

IMPORTANT: Metrics available since {project_name} 27 or newer.

{project_name} caches data in embedded {ispn} caches. The metrics in this section help monitor the caching health.

== Hot Rod client metrics

IMPORTANT: Metrics available since {project_name} 27 or newer.

{project_name} uses the {ispn} Hot Rod client to connection to an external {jdgserver_name} deployment.
