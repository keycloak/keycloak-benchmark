= Installing Keycloak on Minikube

== Prerequisites to the installation

* A network downstream speed of at least 10 Mbps to allow for a timely download of all necessary images and containers.
A slower downstream might lead to timeouts and pods might not start.

* 4 CPU cores, 8 GB of free RAM and free disk space of ~20 GB to run the minikube instance with Keycloak and observability tools inside.

* The following tools need to be installed on the local machine.
+
Each linked page contains an installation description and a command to verify the successful installation of the prerequisite.

== Installing Keycloak Benchmark on minikube

WARNING: If an existing minikube instance exists, this installation replaces it with a new one.

To set up the minikube instance with Keycloak Benchmark, invoke the following commands in this order:

. Check out the Git repository from https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark/.

. Change to the folder `provision/minikube`.

. Run the shell script `./rebuild.sh` to set up a minikube instance.

. Run the `task` command to provision all containers on minikube.
This might take some time until all containers have been pulled from the internet, see <<observing-the-installation>> on how to see how it progresses.
+
While this can complete within 5 minutes with a fast internet downstream speed, this might take up to 15 minutes for slow connections.
A network downstream slower than 10 Mbps might lead to timeouts, and pods might not start with the error code ImagePullBackOff.

When the configuration changes later, re-run the `task` command, and it updates the installation.
Don't run `./rebuild.sh` unless there is the need to re-create the complete Keycloak Benchmark environment as it will take a lot longer and will download all containers from the internet again.

[#observing-the-installation]
== Observing the installation

Run the following command in a separate window to see the different pods starts.
Use kbd:[Ctrl+C] to end watching.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get pods -A -w
----

== Verifying the installation

include::partial$isup-bash-version-macos.adoc[]

Run the following script to check if all services are running and receive a list of available URLs:

[source,shell]
----
./isup.sh
----

To open a dashboard showing all Kubernetes resources, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
minikube dashboard
----

This should open the URL in the user's default browser.
If it doesn't open it automatically, click on the link it prints on the console.

Then, select a namespace in the header (for example `keycloak`) and browse the resources available in that namespace.
