== Opening SQLPad

The SQLPad is deployed when xref:storage/postgres.adoc[PostgreSQL] or xref:storage/cockroach.adoc[CockroachDB] was chosen as the store.

Assuming the command `minikube ip` returned `192.168.39.39`, the console is available on \http://sqlpad.192.168.39.39.nip.io.

The username is `admin` with the password `admin`.
