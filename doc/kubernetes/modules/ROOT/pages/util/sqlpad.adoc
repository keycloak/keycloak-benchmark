== Opening SQLPad

The SQLPad is deployed when xref:storage/postgres.adoc[PostgreSQL] is chosen as the store.

Assuming the command `minikube ip` returned `192.168.39.39`, the console is available on \http://sqlpad.192.168.39.39.nip.io.

The username is `admin` with the password `admin`.

You can update the configurations associated with SQL Pad container https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark/blob/main/provision/minikube/keycloak/templates/sqlpad.yaml#L25[here]
