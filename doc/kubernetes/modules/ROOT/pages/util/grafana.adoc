== About Grafana

Grafana provides browser-based dashboards.

Visit the https://grafana.com/grafana/[Grafana website] for more information.

== Opening Grafana

Grafana is deployed by default.

Assuming the command `minikube ip` returned `192.168.39.39`, the console is available on \http://grafana.192.168.39.39.nip.io.

== Adding custom dashboards

Login to Grafana with the username `admin` and the password `keycloak` when anonymous login is not sufficient.

Custom dashboards are included in folder `monitoring/dashboards`.
Add more dashboards there as new files, and `task` installs the latest versions in the minikube cluster.
