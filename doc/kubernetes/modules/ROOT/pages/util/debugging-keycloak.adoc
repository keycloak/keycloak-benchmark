= Debugging Keycloak
:description: Analyze problems during development by connecting a debugger on the local machine to Keycloak inside minikube.

{description}
A running version of xref:installation.adoc[Keycloak within Minikube] is a prerequisite.

== Overview

The deployment of Keycloak has debugging enabled by default and opens node port `30012` on minikube.
Developers use their local IDE to connect to the Keycloak instance running in minikube using a JVM remote debugging session.

== How to set it up

Prerequisite:

. xref:installation.adoc[Keycloak installed and running on Minikube]

. Java IDE on the local machine with either a checked-out Keycloak repository matching the deployed version of Keycloak to debug Keycloak, or a checked-out repository of a provider installed into Keycloak that the developer wants to debug.

Setup of remote debugging:

. Determine the IP address of minikube by calling `minikube ip` on a command line.
+
. Set up remote debugging with the host name using the IP address retrieved in the previous step and port number `30012`.

NOTE: The IP address changes when minikube is restarted.

Assuming the command `minikube ip` returned `192.168.39.39`, see an example screenshot from IntelliJ below.

== Caveats when remote debugging Keycloak

* When **running multiple replicas of Keycloak in minikube**, the IDE connects to a random instance.

* When the **Keycloak instance restarts** (for example, due to a re-deployment), the IDE is disconnected automatically and the developer needs to re-start the debugging session.

* When **creating breakpoints** that suspend all threads, this would also suspend the threads that serve the Kubernetes liveness probes.
The probes eventually time out, and Kubernetes restarts the Keycloak pod unexpectedly during the debugging session.
+
Instead, create breakpoints that only suspend the current thread.
In IntelliJ, do this by:
+
. Right-click on the breakpoint.
. Adjust it for the current breakpoint.
. Then make it the default for all future breakpoints.
