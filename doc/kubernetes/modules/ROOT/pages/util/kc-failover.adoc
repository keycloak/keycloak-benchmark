= Simulate Keycloak Site Failover
:description: How to automate the simulation of Keycloak site failures.

== Prerequisites:

* A Keycloak instance replicated across two ROSA clusters with Infinispan xsite and an Aurora DB
* xref:prerequisite/prerequisite-task.adoc[Task]

== Running the failure test from the CLI


== Installation steps

. Check out the Git repository from https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark/.

. Change to the folder `link:{github-files}/provision/rosa-cross-dc/[provision/rosa-cross-dc]`.

. Provide the required variables for the desired task in a `.env` file in the folder.


== Split Brain

Two tasks are provided for split-brain failover, one to cause a split-brain and the other to recover from it:

[source]
----
* split-heal:                             Heal a split-brain simulation by reenabling GossipRouters and reseting the global accelerator endpoints
* split-trigger:                          Disables Infinispan GossipRouters on each cluster to simulate a split-brain scenario
----

|Variable |Details

|ACCELERATOR_NAME
|The unique name of the AWS Global Accelerator used by the deployment.

|ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME_1
|The name of one ROSA cluster.

|ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME_2
|The name of the other ROSA cluster.

== Cluster Failure

Two tasks are provided for simulating cluster failures. One to aggressively delete the Keycloak and Infinispan StatefulSets,
the other to recreate them:

[source]
----
* kill-cluster:                           Delete the Keycloak and Infinispan StatefulSets in the specified cluster
* revive-cluster:                         Recreate the Keycloak and Infinispan StatefulSets in the specified cluster
----

The `kill-cluster` task disables both the Keycloak and Infinispan Operators to prevent the StatefulSets being recreated
automatically. Conversely, the `revive-cluster` re-enables the Operators to allow the StatefulSets to be recreated.

|ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME
|The name of the ROSA cluster.
