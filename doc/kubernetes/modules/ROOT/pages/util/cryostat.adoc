== Opening Cryostat

Cryostat is deployed by default.

The URL is shown when running the `isup.sh` shell script.

=== Minikube

Assuming the command `minikube ip` returned `192.168.39.39`, the console is available on \http://cryostat.192.168.39.39.nip.io.

=== OpenShift

Navigate to the routes of the project where Keycloak is installed.
Open the URL listed for `cryostat`.

== Accessing Grafana

When running minikube, there are no extra credentials necessary to access Grafana.
When running on OpenShift, the https://cryostat.io/guides/#view-a-recording-in-grafana[Cryostat docs contain the details on how to retrieve the password].

== Analyzing a Java Flight Recorder recording

Open the recording in https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ Ultimate] (the community edition isn't sufficient), or use https://jdk.java.net/jmc/8/[Java Mission Control (JMC)] version 8.

When opening it in IntelliJ Ultimate, choose the menu:Profiler[] tool window, and press the button btn:[Open Snapshot].
Choose either the tab menu:Flame Graph[] or menu:Method List[].
In the upper right corner the user can switch between CPU and memory profiling results.

When opening it in JMC, select the menu item menu:Method Profiling[] or menu:Memory[].
Unfortunately, the flame view seems to be broken in version 8.2.1 on Fedora; it is simply blank.
Still, the list of methods provides some value.
