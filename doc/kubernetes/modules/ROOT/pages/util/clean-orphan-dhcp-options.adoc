= Clean the orphaned DHCP options from a ROSA cluster creation

This is a workaround for the following issue https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1838.

We can use the link:{github-files}/provision/aws/rosa_clean_aws_dhcp_options.sh[rosa_clean_aws_dhcp_options.sh] script, to look for dangling DHCP Options Sets and delete them if need be.
