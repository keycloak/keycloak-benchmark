:description: Prometheus collects metrics from services.

== About Prometheus

Prometheus collects metrics from services and the Kubernetes platform and provides them to Grafana.

Visit the https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus website] for more information.

== Opening Prometheus

Prometheus is deployed by default.

Assuming the command `minikube ip` returned `192.168.39.39`, the console is available on \http://prometheus.192.168.39.39.nip.io.

== Running custom queries

Enter an expression in search field and press btn:[Execute] to run the query.
Auto-completion is available.
See the https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/[PromQL docs] on how to run queries.

.Show all metrics retrieved from Keycloak
====
{job='keycloak/keycloak-metrics'}
====

.Show used bytes for different JVM memory pools
====
jvm_memory_used_bytes{job='keycloak/keycloak-metrics'}
====

To show a minimal graph, switch to the **Graph** tab.

[NOTE]
====
While this is good for ad hoc queries, use xref:util/grafana.adoc[Grafana] for advanced dashboards which can be persisted.
====

== Diagnostics

Open the menu menu:Status[Configuration] to see the configuration which is auto-generated from the different custom resources created for Prometheus in Kubernetes.

Open the menu menu:Status[Targets] to see if Prometheus can connect to all targets to collect the metrics.
