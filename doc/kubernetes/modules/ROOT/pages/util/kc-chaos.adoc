= Simulate failures of Keycloak in Kubernetes
:description: How to automate the simulation of failures Keycloak Pods in a Kubernetes environment to test the recovery of Keycloak after a failure.

{description}

== Why failure testing

There is an excellent writeup about why we need chaos testing tools in general https://redhat-chaos.github.io/krkn/#introduction[in the introduction to the chaos testing tool krkn].

== Running the failure test using `kc-chaos.sh` script

=== Preparations

* Extract the `+keycloak-benchmark-${version}.[zip|tar.gz]+` file
* xref:benchmark-guide::preparing-keycloak.adoc[]
* Make sure you can access the Kubernetes cluster from where you are planning to run the failure tests and run commands such as `kubectl get pods -n keycloak-keycloak`

=== Simulating load

Use the xref:benchmark-guide::run/running-benchmark-cli.adoc[] guide to simulate load against a specific Kubernetes environment.

=== Running the failure tests

Once there is enough load going against the Keycloak application hosted on an existing Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, execute below command to:

[source,bash]
----
./kc-chaos.sh <RESULT_DIR_PATH>
----

Set the environment variables below to configure on how and where this script gets executed.

`INITIAL_DELAY_SECS`:: Time in seconds the script waits before it triggers the first failure.

`CHAOS_DELAY_SECS`:: Time in seconds the script waits between simulating failures.

`PROJECT`:: Namespace of the Keycloak pods.


=== Collecting the results

The chaos script also collects information about the Keycloak failures, Keycloak pod utilization, Keycloak pod restarts, Keycloak logs before killing the keycloak pod and at the end of the run and store them under the `results/logs` directory.

== Running the failure test using Krkn Chaos testing framework

We integrated a Chaos testing framework https://krkn-chaos.github.io/krkn/[krkn] as part of a Taskfile https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark/blob/main/provision/rosa-cross-dc/Chaos.yaml[Chaos.yaml] and created individual tasks to run the `pod-scenarios` test against different components within the multi-site setup of Keycloak on Kubernetes.
It focuses on simulating Pod failure scenarios for Keycloak and Infinispan applications.

=== Preparations

* This Taskfile requires Podman/Docker to be installed and configured on the system.
* The Kubernetes configuration file for the ROSA cluster must be available in the specified `ISPN_DIR` directory.
* Make sure to set the required environment variables before running the tasks.
* You can customize the behavior of the tasks by overriding the default values for the variables.

==== kraken-pod-scenarios
This is an internal task that provides the core functionality for running Kraken pod failure scenarios. It uses the pod-scenarios image from the https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn-hub/tree/main[krkn-chaos/krkn-hub] repository. The task requires the following variables:

`ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME`:: The name of the ROSA cluster
`POD_LABEL`:: A label selector to identify the target pods
`EXPECTED_POD_COUNT`:: The expected number of pods after the disruption
`ISPN_DIR`:: The directory containing the Infinispan configuration

The task sets some default values for variables like `DEFAULT_NAMESPACE`, `DISRUPTION_COUNT`, `WAIT_DURATION`, and `ITERATIONS`. It also has a precondition to ensure the existence of the Kubernetes configuration file.

==== kill-gossip-router
This task kills the JGroups Gossip Router pod in the Infinispan cluster. It calls the `kraken-pod-scenarios` task with specific values for `POD_LABEL`, `DISRUPTION_COUNT`, and `EXPECTED_POD_COUNT`.

[WARNING]
====
Right now, the `kill-gossip-router` task fails with an `timeout while waiting for pods to come up` error message, which needs to be fixed and currently tracked under https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark/issues/943[a GitHub issue].
====

==== kill-infinispan
This task kills a random Infinispan pod. It calls the kraken-pod-scenarios task with appropriate values for  `POD_LABEL`, `DISRUPTION_COUNT`, and `EXPECTED_POD_COUNT`. The default value for `EXPECTED_POD_COUNT` is calculated based on the `CROSS_DC_ISPN_REPLICAS` variable (or 3 if not set).

==== kill-keycloak
This task kills a random Keycloak pod. It calls the kraken-pod-scenarios task with specific values for  `POD_LABEL`, `DISRUPTION_COUNT`, and `EXPECTED_POD_COUNT`. The default value for `EXPECTED_POD_COUNT` is calculated based on the `KC_INSTANCES` variable (or 1 if not set).


=== Limitations

* Currently, we are not able to peek into the Krkn report which gets generated inside the kraken pod but gets removed as its ephemeral storage. This is currently planned to be fixed and tracked in https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark/issues/942[a GitHub issue].
