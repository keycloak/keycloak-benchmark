= Analyzing the Continuous Performance Test results
:description: A utility to perform custom analysis on the generated results from continuous performance tests.

== Continuous Performance Tests
The link:{github-files}/.github/workflows/rosa-cluster-auto-provision-on-schedule.yml[ROSA Daily Scheduled Run workflow] is an automated process that ensures continuous performance testing which is scheduled to run every weekday.

This workflow initiates by deploying a multi-AZ cluster, activating features such as external Infinispan and persistent sessions. It executes a series of functional tests to verify the system's performance and stability in an active-active configuration.

Following these tests, a scaling benchmark assesses the system's ability to handle varying loads, providing crucial insights into performance under real-world conditions and the results are then persisted to a `https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark/tree/result-data/rosa_scalability[result-data branch]` in the benchmark's GitHub repository for further analysis.

This automated schedule ensures consistent testing, early detection of potential issues, and continuous improvement of {project_name}'s performance.

== Analyze the results

We have a Python script `link:{github-files}/benchmark/src/main/python/perfInsights.py[perfInsights.py]` which allows us to analyze the results generated from the Continuous Performance tests mentioned above.

=== Installing needed python libraries

[source,bash]
----
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
----

And we can check if all the requirements are satisfied using the below command.
[source,bash]
----
python3 -m pip check
----

=== Usage

Run the below command to access the results from the `https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark/tree/result-data/rosa_scalability[result-data branch]` and save the analysis to a local dir.

[source, bash]
----
python3 perfInsights.py <result_json_dir_path_on_github> <output_dir_path>
----

[source, bash]
----
Example:
python3 perfInsights.py rosa_scalability/2024/07/23 results
----
