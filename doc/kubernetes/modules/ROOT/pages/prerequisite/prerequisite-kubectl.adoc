:navtitle: Installing kubectl
:description: Kubectl is a pre-requisite to provision applications to Kubernetes.

{description}
It needs to be installed before the  xref:installation.adoc[] can begin.

== Installing kubectl

The recommended installation is to download the latest binary from the Helm homepage and put it into the user's `~/bin` directory.

The installation guide is available in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[Kubernetes tools installation guide].

== Optional installation steps for kubectl

Add the following snippet to the file `~/.bashrc` to allow auto-completion of commands:

[source,bash]
----
source <(kubectl completion bash)
----

== Verifying the installation of kubectl

The command:

// avoid calling `kubectl version` here, as it trys to connect to minikube that might then fail or timeout
[source,bash]
----
kubectl --help
----

Should print an output like:

----
kubectl controls the Kubernetes cluster manager.
...
----
