= Connecting to OpenShift as a pre-requisite
:navtitle: Connecting to OpenShift
:description: OpenShift is a pre-requisite if the setup is about to be tested on OpenShift.

{description}
It needs to be completed before xref:installation-openshift.adoc[] can begin.

== Prerequisites

This requires a running OpenShift instance, any OpenShift instance should work.

To set up OpenShift on AWS, use xref:prerequisite/prerequisite-rosa.adoc[Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA)].

URL to the console of OpenShift::
Usually a URL in the form of:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
https://console-openshift-console.apps.**<domain name>**/
----

URL to the API of OpenShift::
Usually a URL in the form of:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
https://api.**<domain name>**:6443/
----

User credentials::
OpenShift user login name and password with `cluster-admin` role to be able to install custom resource definitions.

== Connecting to OpenShift

. Log in to the OpenShift console.
. Navigate to the question mark icon `(?)` in the upper right corner and choose *Command line tools*
. Download the `oc` binary for your operating system.
. On Linux, extract it to the folder `~/.bin`
. Add the following snippet to the file `~/.bashrc` to allow auto-completion of commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
source <(oc completion bash)
----

== Verifying the installation

The command:

[source,bash]
----
oc version
----

Should print an output like:

----
Client Version: 4.12.0-...
Kustomize Version: v4.5.7
Server Version: 4.12.13
Kubernetes Version: v1.25.8+27e744f
----

The major and minor version for the client and the server should match (`4.12` in the example shown above).

== Logging in on the command line

Use the following command to log in on the command line and have it prompt for the password.
Once you log in, the context switches automatically to that cluster.
To switch back for example to the minikube cluster, see <<switching-between-different-kubernetes-clusters>> below.

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
oc login https://api.**<domain name>**:6443 -u **<username>**
----

NOTE: The session will expire approximately one a day, and you'll need to re-login.

== Enable alert routing for user-defined projects

By default, OpenShift HCP doesn't enable alert routing for user-defined projects.

Apply the following ConfigMap link:{github-files}/provision/openshift/cluster-monitoring-config.yaml[cluster-monitoring-config.yaml] which is located in the `/provision/openshift` folder to OpenShift:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n openshift-monitoring -f cluster-monitoring-config.yaml
----

After this has been deployed, several new pods spin up in the *openshift-user-workload-monitoring* namespace:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring
----

Alerts defined in `PrometheusRule` CR are then available to view in the menu entry *Observe->Alerting* in the OpenShift console.

[#switching-between-different-kubernetes-clusters]
== Switching between different Kubernetes clusters

To switch between different clusters, use the following commands:

.List available contexts to switch between
[source,bash]
----
kubectl config get-contexts
----

.Select/Input the Context to Switch to

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
kubectl config use-context **<context>**
----
