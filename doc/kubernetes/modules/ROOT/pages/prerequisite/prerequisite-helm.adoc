= Installing Helm as a pre-requisite
:navtitle: Installing Helm
:description: Helm is a pre-requisite to provision applications to Kubernetes.

{description}
It needs to be installed before the  xref:installation.adoc[] can begin.

== Installing Helm

The recommended installation is to download the latest binary from the Helm homepage and put it into the user's `~/bin` directory.

The installation guide is available in the https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm installation guide].

== Optional installation steps for Helm

Add the following snippet to the file `~/.bashrc` to allow auto-completion of commands:

[source,bash]
----
source <(helm completion bash)
----

== Verifying the installation of Helm

The command:

[source,bash]
----
helm version
----

Should print an output like:

----
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.8.2", GitCommit:"...", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.17.5"}
----
