= Installing task as a pre-requisite
:navtitle: Installing task
:description: Task is a pre-requisite to provision Keycloak Benchmark to Kubernetes.

{description}
It needs to be installed before the  xref:installation.adoc[] can begin.

== Installing task

The recommended installation is to download the latest binary from task's GitHub releases and put it into the user's `~/bin` directory.

The installation guide is available in the https://taskfile.dev/installation/#get-the-binary[Task installation guide].

[NOTE]
====
On Fedora and other Linux distributions, the user can also install the package `go-task`.
If a user chooses to do so, the binary is called `go-task` (instead of `task`).
Users then need to execute `go-task` in all the places this manual asks to run `task`, or create an alias for that command.
====

== Optional installation steps for task

Add the following snippet to the file `~/.bashrc` to allow auto-completion of task commands.

[source,bash]
----
_task_completion()
{
  local scripts;
  local curr_arg;

  # Remove colon from work breaks
  COMP_WORDBREAKS=${COMP_WORDBREAKS//:}

  scripts=$(task -l | sed '1d' | sed 's/^\* //' | awk '{ print $1 }');

  curr_arg="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]:-"."}"

  # Do not accept more than 1 argument
  if [ "${#COMP_WORDS[@]}" != "2" ]; then
    return
  fi

  COMPREPLY=($(compgen -c | echo "$scripts" | grep $curr_arg));
}

complete -F _task_completion task
----

== Verifying the installation of task

The command:

[source,bash]
----
task --version
----

Should print an output like:

----
Task version: v3.13.0 (h1:...)
----
