= Using Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL storage
:description: An Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL instance can be used as the underlying database for Keycloak in either single,
or multi-site configurations. Currently this is only supported with Keycloak deployments on ROSA.

== Deploying an Aurora Cluster

Aurora clusters can be deployed to your AWS region of choice by executing `./provision/aws/rds/aurora_create.sh` with the
following env:

[source]
----
AURORA_CLUSTER= # The name of the Aurora cluster
AURORA_REGION= # The AWS region hosting the Aurora cluster
----

This creates the necessary VPCs, subnets and routes required by an Aurora cluster as well as a single Aurora instance
for said cluster. The script waits until both the cluster and instance are available. If the cluster already exists,
a message indiciating this is displayed and the script will fail with exit code 1.

[NOTE]
====
The specified `AURORA_CLUSTER` must be unique per the AWS region and follow the conventions outlined for the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.CreateInstance.html#Aurora.CreateInstance.Settings["DB cluster identifier"].
====

== Connecting ROSA cluster to Aurora Cluster

In order to follow security best practices, the Aurora cluster is not exposed publicly over the internet. Instead, it's
necessary for us to establish a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html[Peering Connection]
between a ROSA cluster VPC and the Aurora Cluster VPC.

To configure such a connection execute `./provision/aws/rds/aurora_create_peering_connection.sh` with the following env:

[source]
----
AURORA_CLUSTER= # The name of the Aurora cluster
AURORA_REGION= # The AWS region hosting the Aurora cluster
CLUSTER_NAME= # The name of the ROSA cluster to establish the peering connectin with
AWS_REGION= # The AWS region hosting the ROSA cluster
----

NOTE: If connecting multiple ROSA clusters from different AWS regions to the Aurora DB, it's necessary for each cluster
to have non-overlapping machine-cidr configured.

== Enabling Aurora PostgreSQL storage

Use the following settings to configure the Aurora store:

[source]
----
KC_DATABASE=aurora-postgres
KC_DATABASE_URL=aws.example.route.com
----

The `KC_DATABASE_URL` should be the exposed endpoint of the Aurora writer instances. This can be obtained by executing
the `./provision/aws/rds/aurora_endpoint.sh` script with the following env:

[source]
----
AURORA_CLUSTER= # The name of the Aurora cluster instance
AURORA_REGION= # The AWS region hosting the Aurora cluster
----

See xref:customizing-deployment.adoc[] for a list of all configuration options.

== Debugging Aurora PostgreSQL

The Aurora DB cluster is only accessible to ROSA clusters with an established Peering Connection, therefore all debugging
connections must also originate from said clusters. A simple way to connect `psql` to the cluster is to execute the following:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl run -i --tty --rm debug --image=postgres:13 --restart=Never -n {{.KC_NAMESPACE_PREFIX}}keycloak -- psql -h postgres -d keycloak -U keycloak
----

This will create a pod in the Keycloak deployment namespace and establish a connection with the Aurora cluster. A password
prompt will appear on initial connection and you should utilise the password defined in the Secret `keycloak-db-secret`.
Upon exiting the pod shell, the pod will be deleted.

== Disconnecting ROSA cluster from Aurora Cluster

To remove a Peering Connection between the ROSA and Aurora VPCS, execute `./provision/aws/rds/aurora_delete_peering_connection.sh`
wit the the following env:

[source]
----
AURORA_CLUSTER= # The name of the Aurora cluster instance
AURORA_REGION= # The AWS region hosting the Aurora cluster
CLUSTER_NAME= # The name of the ROSA cluster to establish the peering connectin with
AWS_REGION= # The AWS region hosting the ROSA cluster
----

== Deleting an Aurora Cluster
Before deleting an Aurora cluster it's first necessary for all Peering Connections established with ROSA cluster(s) to
be removed.

To remove an Aurora cluster, execute `./provision/aws/rds/aurora_delete.sh` with the following env:

[source]
----
AURORA_CLUSTER= # The name of the Aurora cluster instance
AURORA_REGION= # The AWS region hosting the Aurora cluster
----
