== Enabling Concurrent Hash Map storage

Using a Concurrent Hash Map database is available for the new map storage.
It can be enabled via the following settings in the `.env` file in the `provision/kubernetes` folder:

[source]
----
KC_DATABASE=none
KC_STORAGE=chm
----

See xref:customizing-deployment.adoc[] for a list of all configuration options.

The Concurrent Hash Map storage is built-in into Keycloak, no extra pod is started.
Every time the Keycloak pod is restarted, the data is cleared.

Keycloak connects to the Concurrent Hash Map database pod inside minikube and populates the DB schema.

The data inside the Concurrent Hash Map store is not accessible from the outside of Keycloak.
