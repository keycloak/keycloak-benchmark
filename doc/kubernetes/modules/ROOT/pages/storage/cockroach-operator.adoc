= Using CockroachDB with an Operator
:description: The deployment of Keycloak can use a multi-node CockroachDB setup using the CockroachDB operator.

{description}

As an alternative CockroachDB setup, there is also xref:./cockroach-single.adoc[] which uses fewer resources.

WARNING: Please see <<known-issues-for-cockroachdb-operator-based-setup>> below.

== Enabling CockroachDB storage

Using a CockroachDB operator installation is available in Keycloak's new JPA map storage.
It can be enabled via the following settings in the `.env` file in the `provision/kubernetes` folder:

[source]
----
KC_DATABASE=cockroach-operator
KC_STORAGE=jpa
----

In the default https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark/tree/main/provision/minikube/keycloak/templates/cockroach-operator/cockroach.yaml#L26[configuration], the CockroachDB with an Operator brings up 3 CockroachDB pods.

See xref:customizing-deployment.adoc[] for a list of all Keycloak configuration options.

include::partial$rerun-task-after-changes.adoc[]

The deployment adds a CockroachDB operator which then spins up three CockroachDB nodes to the minikube setup and removes all other storage pods that are no longer necessary.
All connections to the database are TLS encrypted, and Keycloak uses a private key and a certificate to authenticate towards the database.

Keycloak connects to the CockroachDB database pod inside minikube and populates the DB schema.
The xref:util/sqlpad.adoc[SQL Pad] allows accessing the database via the browser.

== Learning more about the CockroachDB operator

The documentation is available online in the https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/kubernetes-overview.html[CockroachDB docs] and https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-operator[the Operator's GitHub repository].

== Verifying the setup

The automated script verifies that Keycloak starts up, which requires that CockroachDB start up first.
A user can test the setup by <<accessing-the-cockroachdb-console,accessing CockroachDB's console>>.

[#accessing-the-cockroachdb-console]
== Accessing the CockroachDB console

Assuming the command `minikube ip` returned `192.168.39.39`, the console is available on \http://cockroach.192.168.39.39.nip.io.

The username is `keycloak`, password is `keycloak`.

include::partial$minikube-ip-change.adoc[]

== Connecting a local application to CockroachDB

CockroachDB's database port is also available as a node port so that it can be accessed from a local application.
Assuming the command `minikube ip` returned `192.168.39.39`, the JDBC URL is `jdbc:postgres://192.168.39.39:30013/keycloak?sslmode=disable`.

include::partial$minikube-ip-change.adoc[]

It can be used, for example, to connect the developer's IDE to the database.

The connection details: Port is always `30013`, username is `root`, database name is `keycloak`.

include::partial$port-offset-note.adoc[]

Authentication is handled via TLS.
The necessary files are located in `privision/minikube/crdb` as `ca.crt`, `tls.crt` and `tls.key`.

To connect on the commandline to the CockroachDB, use the following command, which will connect as the `root` user and will authenticate using the certificate stores in minikube.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n keycloak exec -it cockroach-client-secure-0 -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach/cockroach-certs --host=cockroach-public
----

== Metrics and Dashboards for CockroachDB

Metrics from the CockroachDB are available in Prometheus, and dashboards are available in Grafana.
They are named "`CDRB Console: SQL`", "`CDRB Console: Runtime`" and "`CDRB Console: Storage`".
The dashboards have been taken from https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/monitor-cockroachdb-with-prometheus.html[the CockroachDB manual] and adapted for the Job name.

To see all metrics, query Prometheus for `+{job="keycloak/cockroach-metrics"}+`.

[#known-issues-for-cockroachdb-operator-based-setup]
== Known issues for CockroachDB operator-based setup

Users of this setup should be aware of the following known issues.

include::partial$cockroach-retry.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

=== Long shutdown times for CockroachDB nodes

When shutting down the nodes after deleting the CockroachDB custom resource with a command like this ...

----
kubectl -n keycloak delete crdbclusters.crdb.cockroachlabs.com/cockroach
----

\... then the shutdown of the last node might take up to five minutes.
Until that shutdown is complete, no new CockroachDB instance with the same name can be instantiated via the `task` command.

=== CockroachDB Operator will not clean persistent storage

When removing a CockroachDB cluster that has been created by the CockroachDB operator, the persistence volume claims (PVCs) and the persistent volumes (PVs) are retained, so that a recreated cluster will have its database restored.

To reset the database, there's a script `init-database.sh` that is called when running `task reset-keycloak`.

To remove the PVCs and PVs and also the secrets connected to it, this needs to be done manually either via the command line of the minikube dashboard.

=== CockroachDB Operator needs to run to modify CockroachDB custom resource

When the CockroachDB operator is not running, no CockroachDB custom resource can be modified, as the callback that's registered in Kubernetes is not available.

When this happens, have a look at the pod running in the namespace `keycloak` and ensure that it is running.
If it is in BackOff or Error state, consider killing it and waiting for it to restart.

=== Status in the CockroachDB custom resource is not updated

After the cluster has been initialized, the status in the resource is still `clusterStatus: Failed`, although the database is fully usable.
Due to that, the status of the resource can't be used to monitor the cluster initialization.

See https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-operator/issues/937[cockroach-operator/issues#937] for the status and updates.

=== Automated tests for CockroachDB Operator setup don't run on GitHub actions

It seems that the memory, CPU or disk space constraints that exist on GitHub runners don't allow the full stack of CockroachDB, Keycloak and monitoring tool to spin up for a test run.

Therefore, there is no provisioning test for this on GitHub actions.
Any change to this setup needs to be tested manually.
