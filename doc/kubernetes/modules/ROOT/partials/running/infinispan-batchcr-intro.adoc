The steps uses {ispn} Batch CR to perform the CLI commands.
However, the system administrator may use the CLI tool, and copy/run those commands, connecting via the exposed {ispn} service.

Detailed information about {ispn} Batch CR in the {operator-docs}#batch-cr[documentation page].

To install `ConfigMap` with the {ispn} CLI command, copy the YAML into a file, and install them in the {ocp} cluster using the following command:

[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
oc -n {ns} install -f /path/to/yamlfile
----
