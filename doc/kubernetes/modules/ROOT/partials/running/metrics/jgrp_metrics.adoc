====
*Global tags*

* `cluster=<name>`: The cluster name.
If metrics from multiple clusters are being collected, this tag helps identify where they belong to.
* `node=<node>`: The name of the node reporting the metric.
====

== Response Time

The following metrics expose the response time for the remote requests.
The response time is measured between two nodes and includes the processing time.
All requests are measured by these metrics, and the response time should remain stable through the cluster lifecycle.

TIP: In a healthy cluster, the response time will remain stable.
An increase in response time may indicate a degraded cluster or a node under heavy load.

====
*Tags*

* `node=<node>`: It identifies the sender node.
* `target_node=<node>`: It identifies the receiver node.

|Metric |Description

== Bandwidth

All the bytes received and sent by the {jgrp_application} are collected by these metrics.
Also, all the internal messages, as heartbeats, are counted too.
They allow computing the bandwidth currently used by each node.

IMPORTANT: The metric name depends on the JGroups transport protocol in use.

|===
|Metric |Protocol |Description

m| vendor_jgroups_tcp_get_num_bytes_received
m| TCP
.3+| The total number of bytes received by a node.

m| vendor_jgroups_udp_get_num_bytes_received
m| UDP

m| vendor_jgroups_tunnel_get_num_bytes_received
m| TUNNEL

m| vendor_jgroups_tcp_get_num_bytes_sent
m| TCP
.3+| The total number of bytes sent by a node.

m| vendor_jgroups_tunnel_get_num_bytes_sent
m| UDP

m| vendor_jgroups_tunnel_get_num_bytes_sent
m| TUNNEL


|===

== Thread Pool

Monitoring the thread pool size is a good indicator that a node is under a heavy load.
All requests received are added to the thread pool for processing and, when it is full, the request is discarded.
A retransmission mechanism ensures a reliable communication with an increase of resource usage.

TIP: In a healthy cluster, the thread pool should never be closer to its maximum size (by default, `200` threads).

NOTE: Thread pool metrics are not available with virtual threads.

IMPORTANT: The metric name depends on the JGroups transport protocol in use.

|===
|Metric |Protocol |Description

m| vendor_jgroups_tcp_get_thread_pool_size
m| TCP
.3+|Current number of threads in the thread pool.

m| vendor_jgroups_udp_get_thread_pool_size
m| UDP

m| vendor_jgroups_tunnel_get_thread_pool_size
m| TUNNEL

m| vendor_jgroups_tcp_get_largest_size
m| TCP
.3+| The largest number of threads that have ever simultaneously been in the pool.

m| vendor_jgroups_udp_get_largest_size
m| UDP

m| vendor_jgroups_tunnel_get_largest_size
m| TUNNEL

== Flow Control

Flow control takes care of adjusting the rate of a message sender to the rate of the slowest receiver over time.
This is implemented through a credit-based system, where each sender decrements its credits when sending.
The sender blocks when the credits fall below 0, and only resumes sending messages when it receives a replenishment message from the receivers.

The metrics below show the number of blocked messages and the average blocking time.
When a value is different from zero, it may signal that a receiver is overloaded and may degrade the cluster performance.

Each node has two independent flow control protocols, `UFC` for unicast messages and `MFC` for multicast messages.

TIP: A healthy cluster shows a value of zero for all metrics.

|===
|Metric |Description

m| vendor_jgroups_ufc_get_number_of_blockings
| The number of times flow control blocks the sender for unicast messages.

m| vendor_jgroups_ufc_get_average_time_blocked
| Average time blocked (in ms) in flow control when trying to send an unicast message.

m| vendor_jgroups_mfc_get_number_of_blockings
| The number of times flow control blocks the sender for multicast messages.

m| vendor_jgroups_mfc_get_average_time_blocked
| Average time blocked (in ms) in flow control when trying to send a multicast message.

|===

== Retransmissions

JGroups provides reliable delivery of messages.
When a message is dropped on the network, or the receiver cannot handle the message, a retransmission is required.
Retransmissions increase resource usage, and it is usually a signal of an overload system.

Random Early Drop (RED) monitors the sender queues.
When the queues are almost full, the message is dropped, and a retransmission must happen.
It prevents threads from being blocked by a full sender queue.

TIP: A healthy cluster shows a value of zero for all metrics.

|===
|Metric |Description

m| vendor_jgroups_unicast3_get_num_xmits
| The number of retransmitted messages.

m| vendor_jgroups_red_get_dropped_messages
| The total number of dropped messages by the sender.

m| vendor_jgroups_red_get_drop_rate
| Percentage of all messages that were dropped by the sender.

|===

== Network Partitions

=== Cluster Size

The cluster size metric reports the number of nodes present in the cluster.
If it differs, it may signal that a node is joining, shutdown or, in the worst case, a network partition is happening.

TIP: A healthy cluster shows the same value in all nodes.

|===
|Metric |Description

m| vendor_cluster_size
| The number of nodes in the cluster.

|===

ifdef::cross_site[]

=== Cross-Site Status

The cross-site status reports connection status to the other site.
It returns a value of `1` if is online or `0` if offline.
The value of `2` is used on nodes where the status is unknown; not all nodes establish connections to the remote sites and do not contain this information.

TIP: A healthy cluster shows a value greater than zero.

|===
|Metric |Description

m| vendor_jgroups_site_view_status
| The single site status (1 if online).

|===

====
*Tags*

* `site=<name>`: The name of the destination site.

=== Network Partition Events

Network partitions in a cluster can happen due to various reasons.
This metrics does not help predict network splits but signals that it happened, and the cluster has been merged.

TIP: A healthy cluster shows a value of zero for this metric.

|===
|Metric |Description

m| vendor_jgroups_merge3_get_num_merge_events
| The amount of time a network split was detected and healed.
