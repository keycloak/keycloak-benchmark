== Connection Pool

{project_name} exposes the Hot Rod client connection pool.
For each {jdgserver_name}, a connection pool is created and the sum of all active or idle connection are exposed in the metric.

NOTE: A connection is active if it is currently being used.

|===
|Metric |Description

| `vendor_client_hotrod_connection_pool_idle`
| The number of idle connection.

| `vendor_client_hotrod_connection_pool_active`
| The number of active connection.

| `vendor_client_hotrod_connection_pool_retries_total`
| The total number of requests retried due to network errors.

== Cache Metrics

This section describes the per-cache metrics.

====
*Tags*

* `cache=<name>`: The cache name.

=== Data Access

The Hot Rod client reports the response time for each request.
On a healthy deployment, the response time should be stable with little variance.
Increases in the response time, or spikes, may imply a {jdgserver_name} cluster under heavy load.

Read requests are divided in 2 groups, a read hit or a read miss.
A read is a hit if the value is found in the {jdgserver_name} cluster.

|===
|Metric |Description

| `vendor_client_hotrod_cache_writes_seconds_count`
| The total number of store requests.

| `vendor_client_hotrod_cache_writes_seconds_sum`
| The total duration of all store requests.

| `vendor_client_hotrod_cache_removes_seconds_count`
| The total number of remove requests.

| `vendor_client_hotrod_cache_removes_seconds_sum`
| The total duration of all remove requests.

| `vendor_client_hotrod_cache_reads_hit_seconds_count`
| The total number of read hits requests.

| `vendor_client_hotrod_cache_reads_hit_seconds_sum`
| The total duration of all read hits requests.

| `vendor_client_hotrod_cache_reads_miss_seconds_count`
| The total number of read misses requests.

| `vendor_client_hotrod_cache_reads_miss_seconds_sum`
| The total duration of all read misses requests.
