Due to the bug https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ISPN-14780[ISPN-14780] there is currently no known way to configure the size different from the default JGroups 100 max threads, so assuming a Keycloak cluster with 4 Pods, each Pod shouldn't have more than 25 worker threads.
Use the Quarkus configuration options `quarkus.thread-pool.max-threads` to configure the maximum number of worker threads.
