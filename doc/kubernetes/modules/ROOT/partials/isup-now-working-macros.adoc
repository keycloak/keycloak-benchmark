[WARNING]
====
Currently, the script `isup.sh` doesn't work with macOS, owing to a known https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark/issues/224[problem].
Be aware that it's used within the xref:installation.adoc[Installation] to verify the installation and is a hard dependency for automation to work properly.

Due to this, the installation procedure will currently not work on macOS.
If you're working on macOS, please consider contributing a fix for this issue.
