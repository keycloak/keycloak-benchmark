Assuming a Regional multi-AZ Aurora deployment, the current writer instance should be in the same region as the active Keycloak cluster to avoid latencies and communication across availability zones.

To change the writer instance, run a failover.
Note that this will make the database unavailable for a short time, and database connections need to be reestablished.

To fail over the writer instance to the other AZ, issue the following command:

[source,bash]
----
aws rds failover-db-cluster  --db-cluster-identifier ...
----
